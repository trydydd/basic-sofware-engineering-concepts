# 5. Functions

Functions are reusable pieces of code that can be called with different arguments to perform a specific task. Functions can be built-in or user-defined.

Functions offer several benefits:

1. Reusability: Functions can be written once and used multiple times throughout a program, which reduces code duplication and makes code more maintainable.

2. Modularity: Functions can be used to break down a large program into smaller, more manageable pieces, which makes code easier to understand and debug.

3. Encapsulation: Functions can encapsulate complex logic and algorithms, which makes code more organized and easier to read.

4. Abstraction: Functions can provide a simple and clear interface to a complex piece of code, which makes code more user-friendly and easier to use.

5. Testing: Functions can be tested independently of the rest of the program, which makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.
```python
# Example of a function in Python

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```
