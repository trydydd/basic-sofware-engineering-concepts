# Comments

Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable. They are ignored by the interpreter or compiler during the execution of a program. 

- Single-line comments: Single-line comments are used to add comments on a single line of code. They are denoted by two forward slashes in most programming languages.

- Multi-line comments: Multi-line comments are used to add comments that span multiple lines of code. They are denoted by a forward slash followed by an asterisk at the beginning of the comment and an asterisk followed by a forward slash at the end of the comment.

- Documentation comments: Documentation comments are used to generate documentation for code. They are often used to document functions or classes and provide information on their purpose, parameters, return values, and other relevant details. Documentation comments are denoted by special syntax in most programming languages, such as JavaDoc or Python's docstrings.

- Inline comments: Inline comments are used to add comments next to a specific line of code.

Comments should be used in code to provide additional information and context about the code. Here are some examples of when comments can be useful:

    To explain the purpose or functionality of a block of code
    To provide information on the input or output of a function
    To document the author or date of a piece of code
    To provide a summary of changes made to a piece of code
    To provide a warning or note about potential issues or bugs
    To describe complex algorithms or logic
    To provide instructions on how to use or modify the code

Comments should be used sparingly and only when necessary. Over-commenting can make code harder to read and maintain, so it's important to use comments effectively and consistently to make code more understandable and maintainable.

```python
# Example of comments in Python

# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line
comment
"""

# Calculate the sum of two numbers
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # Return the result
```
