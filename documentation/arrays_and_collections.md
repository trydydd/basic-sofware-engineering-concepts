# Arrays and Collections

Arrays and collections are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Some common types of arrays and collections are:

## Lists

Lists are a collection of values that are ordered and changeable. They are denoted by square brackets (`[]`) and can contain any data type, including other lists. Lists can be modified by adding, removing, or changing elements.

## Arrays

Arrays are similar to lists, but they are homogeneous, meaning that they can only contain elements of the same data type. They are used to store and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently. In some programming languages, arrays are denoted by square brackets ([]), while in others, they are denoted by the array() function.

## Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed once they are created. They are denoted by parentheses (`()`) and can contain any data type, including other tuples.

## Sets

Sets are a collection of unique values that are unordered and changeable. They are denoted by curly braces (`{}`) or by using the `set()` function. Sets can be modified by adding or removing elements, but they cannot contain duplicate values.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a collection of key-value pairs that are unordered and changeable. They are denoted by curly braces (`{}`) and use colons (`:`) to separate keys and values. Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers), while values can be any data type, including other dictionaries. Dictionaries can be modified by adding, removing, or changing key-value pairs.

These collection types are essential in programming and can be used to store, organize, and manipulate data in various ways.

```python
# Examples of arrays and collections in Python

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_dictionary = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
```
