# Operators

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Common operators include:

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)

```python
# Examples of operators in Python
result = 10 + 5  # Arithmetic operator
is_equal = (result == 15)  # Comparison operator
not_equal = not is_equal  # Logical operator
```
