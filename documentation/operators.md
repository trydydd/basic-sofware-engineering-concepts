# Operators

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Common operators include:

## Arithmetic operators
`+`: The plus sign is used as the addition operator in most programming languages.
- `-`: The minus sign is used as the subtraction operator in most programming languages.
- `*`: The asterisk or star symbol is used as the multiplication operator in most programming languages.
- `/`: The forward slash is used as the division operator in most programming languages.
- `%`: The percent sign is used as the modulus operator in most programming languages, which returns the remainder of a division operation.

## Comparison operators
- `==`: The double equals sign is used to test whether two values are equal to each other.
- `!=`: The exclamation mark followed by the equals sign is used to test whether two values are not equal to each other.
- `<`: The less-than sign is used to test whether one value is less than another.
- `>`: The greater-than sign is used to test whether one value is greater than another.
- `<=`: The less-than or equal-to sign is used to test whether one value is less than or equal to another.
- `>=`: The greater-than or equal-to sign is used to test whether one value is greater than or equal to another.

## Logical operators
- `&&` (AND): The double ampersand is used to test whether two conditions are both true.
- `||` (OR): The double vertical bar is used to test whether at least one of two conditions is true.
- `!` (NOT): The exclamation mark is used to invert the truth value of a condition (i.e., true becomes false and false becomes true).

```python
# Examples of operators in Python
result = 10 + 5  # Arithmetic operator
is_equal = (result == 15)  # Comparison operator
not_equal = not is_equal  # Logical operator
```
