# Data Types

Data types are used to classify different types of data that can be stored in variables. Some common data types are:

- Integers:  Whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) that do not have a fractional component.
- Floating-point numbers: Numbers that have a fractional component, represented with a decimal point.
- Booleans: Logical values that can be either true or false.
- Characters: Single letters, digits, or symbols that can be represented by a computer. C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic all have a character data type.
- Strings: Sequences of characters that represent text or other data.
