# Variables

Variables are used to store data in a program. They act as placeholders or containers for values that can change during the execution of a program.

## Declaration and Assignment

In most languages, you must declare a variable before you can use it. Declaration involves specifying the variable's name and sometimes its data type. Assignment is the process of assigning a value to a variable.

```python
# Declaration and assignment
my_variable = 10

# Declaration (in languages like C or Java)
int my_variable;

# Assignment
my_variable = 10;
```
